Introduction
============

django-jux/JUXD is an attempt to get JUnit-style XML output from the Django test runner.
It does a few notable things:

* Uses the test runner from the ``django.utils.unittest`` abstraction layer (Django >= 1.6 required)
* Does not redefine the behavior of the test suite's ``run`` method
* Does not redefine the behavior of the test runner's ``run_suite`` method
* Includes test suite run time as well as individual test run times
* Supports all available unittest2 outcomes (success, failure, error, etc...)
* Works with builtin ElementTree to generate the XML output

This job can be done using nose's xunit plugin, but with the unittest 
improvements in Python 2.7, my only reason for using nose was for the xunit 
plugin itself. nose is a bit of a heavy hitter, but it's a (really good) 
generic test runner, not django specific. I wanted something a little more 
targeted, and this is the result.

The main motivator behind this was getting test output into Jenkins CI,
which works perfectly.

Installation
============

Install Django >=1.6 and set up a project.
Then, in your django project settings:

::

    # Tell Django to use the JUXD Test Suite Runner
    TEST_RUNNER = 'juxd.JUXDTestSuiteRunner'
    # Where to write the output 
    JUXD_FILENAME = '/path/to/junit.xml'
